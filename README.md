# COSP webpage

Welcome to the COSP web pages. This repository hosts the COSP web pages, and it is independent from the sister repository that hosts the [code](https://github.com/CFMIP/COSPv2.0).

## Information for COSP users
The installation instructions are in the [README](https://github.com/CFMIP/COSPv2.0/README.md) file of the code repository.

Here, we provide some addtional information for users:
- [Users issues:](users_issues.md) progress on issues raised by users during the 2017 Paris Workshop, and the users discussions in the CFMIP meetings. 
- [CFMIP3 Papers:](cfmip3_papers.md) table with information on leaders and contributions to papers that will use CFMIP3 output.

## Information for COSP developers
If you plan to contribute to COSP, it is imperative that you read the following two documents:
